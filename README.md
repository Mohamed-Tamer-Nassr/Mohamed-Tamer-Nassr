I’m not just learning AI — I’m *living* it.  
From neural networks to natural language processing, I’m diving deep into Machine Learning, Data Science, and real-world AI applications.

Every project I build is a challenge I embrace.  
Every bug I fix is a lesson I own.  
Every dataset I explore is a story I want to tell through intelligent systems.
